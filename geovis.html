                    <h2>Background and Context</h2>
                     <p> Previous research on National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in Africa has shown high latency in traffic exchanged between networks, with 75% of this traffic taking circuitous routes through Europe. Possible reasons for this high latency is lack of peering relationships between NRENs. Peering is when different Internet Service Providers (ISPs) exchange data between their networks at an Internet Exhange Point (IXP).  </p> 

                     <p>Despite an increase in the establishment of national IXPs in Africa, high latencies still occur indicating a need for further research into the network topology of NRENs. The collection of traceroute data for logical topology discovery is therefore necessary in order to understand the underlying topology of African NRENs. Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to determine end-to-end paths of network packets where round trip times are relayed at each router hop. </p>

                     <p>For this reason, a visualisation would be useful in identifying possible routes that network traffic traverses between NRENs and aid in the peering decision-making process.
                        As location is an important aspect in determining this information, a geospatial visualisation has been identified as being appropriate. A geospatial visualisation is one in which nodes are represented in respect to physical locations. 
                    </p>
                   The creation and design of a geospatial visualisation is presented showing the network structure of African NRENs using traceroute data for network topology discovery. 

                    </p> 

                    <h2>Research Question</h2>
                    <h4 class="subheading">The following research question has been formulated for the project:  </h4>
                    Can a geospatial visualisation effectively and accurately communicate the network topology of African NRENs, allowing users to:
                    <li> identify networks (physical and logical), </li> 
                    <li> where they connect (location of source, destination and intermediate hops) </li> 
                    <li> and potential routes of traffic traversal (traceroute paths at a country and continent level)? </li>

                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>A User-Centred Design (UCD) approach was used to develop the visualisation. UCD describes a process where the user is involved throughout the design cycle to determine user needs and goals. In context of a visualisation, this would be gaining an understanding of the initial visual queries (an information need addressed by a visualisation) that potential users may have. </p>

                     <p>Users of the visualisation are envisaged to be NREN managers and network engineers of related tertiary education institutions of the UbuntuNet Alliance.  </p>

                    <p>The design process consists of three phases (Figure 1): 
                        <ol> 
                            <li>the early envisioning phase</li>
                            <li>the global specification phase</li> 
                            <li>the detailed specification phase</li>
                            </ol> 

                            In each phase, analysis, design and evaluation were conducted. </p>

                        <p>Iteration of the design cycle is concluded once a specific criteria has been reached - such as if users are able to adequately answer visual queries. Two iterations were conducted (early envisioning and global speciffication phases) before the final visualisation was designed.</p>

                    <h2>Initial Visualisation Design</h2>
                    <p>An interactive prototype (Figure 2) with limited functionality was produced using the Google Maps Javascript API v3 and a small sample of traceroute data collected from the Ripe Atlas platform. The MaxMind GeoLite City Database was used to map IP addresses to coordinates on a city level and used to position markers on the map for both probes and destination IP addresses. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Map Symbols</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Destination IPs: <font color="blue">Blue</font> Circles</li>
                            <li>NREN Probes: <font color="red">Red</font> Markers</li> 
                            <li>University Probes: <font color="magenta">Purple</font> Markers</li>
                            <li>Traceroute: Line with animated arrow joining destination IP icon and probes</li>
                            <li>Undersea fibre cables: Coloured lines around Africa where thickness of line represents capacity (GB)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>An informal user feedback evaluation was conducted with the expert user group to get feedback on the visualisation. Users had differing opinions on the undersea fibre overlay surrounding Africa: one user thought the multiple lines and colours in the overlay added too much noise to the visualisation and should be removed while another thought it was useful to perhaps reason which cable was taken by the traceroute to the destination. </p>

                                    <h2>Final Visualisation Design</h2>

                <p>Figure 3 shows the final visualisation design based on information received in both the first and second iteration. In addition to the Google Maps Javascript API, the DataTable, javascript table plug-in for jQuery was used. </p>

                <p>Several dimensions of data are displayed in the visualisation including the location of Internet Exchange Points, physical fibre cables and the traceroute information collected. IXP data was obtained from Packet Clearing House's <a href="https://prefix.pch.net/applications/ixpdir/menu_download.php">Internet exchange point directory</a> and fibre data from <a href="https://manypossibilities.net/afterfibre/"> Steve Song</a> at <a href="https://manypossibilities.net/afterfibre/">afterfibre.net</a>. The visualisation allows for viewing multiple traceroutes sent from various vantage points to be seen on the map all at once</p>

                    <p>The left-hand side of the screen shows an interactive map which supports panning and zooming using the mouse. On the right-hand side of the screen, a table with contextual information related to the map can be seen. The search bar above the table on the right-hand side of the screen can be used to perform searches on the table for any column. Clicking on a particular row in the table, allows the map to zoom in to the location of the related icon on the map.</p>

                <h4>Map Layers and Symbols</h4>
                <p>Below the map, there are several checkboxes which can be used to toggle various map layers on and off - either displaying or hiding icons and layers on the map.</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>Destination IP Address - where a traceroute is sent to (coloured circle)</li>
                <li>Probe - where a traceroute is sent from (<font color="blue">blue</font> diamond)</li>
                    <li>Internet Exchange Point (<font color="DeepPink">pink</font> triangle)</li>
                    <li>Traceroute Hops -  (<font color="SpringGreen">bright</font> green circle)</li>
                   <li> Terrestrial Fibre - Fibre Optic Cables over land (<font color="green">green</font> lines)   </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By default, all destination IPs are shown on the map. With the exception of hops, mousing over each symbol displays information about that particular icon such as the name, ASN and IP Address.</p>
                <h4>Summary of Interactions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>To view all traceroute measurements to a particular destination (Figure 4):</b> 
                    Click on a chosen destination IP icon on the map. This will display traceroute measurements from all available probes to that particular destination. All probes, the destination IP and intermediate hops are shown on the map. A list of all the probes and related information (Probe ID, ASN, NREN/organisation name) is then shown in the table.</li>
                    <li><b>To view a single traceroute measurement from a particular probe to a particular destination (Figure 5):</b> Click a chosen probe icon on the map. This will display the traceroute from the chosen probe to the chosen destination. The traceroute information is then shown in the table (Hop Number, Country, IP Address, RTT).</li>
                    <li><b>To select a different IP address:</b> Click the same destination IP icon you previously selected. All destination IP addresses will be visible on the map again.</li>
                </ul>
