	<h3>What is AfriNREN?</h3>
	<p>
		AfriNREN is an Computer Science honours project at the University of Cape Town aiming to design and develop a network traffic and analysis tool for use by network managers of African NRENs. The tool will be available as a Web application, accessible by the intended users by the end of the project period. The project is split into two arenas: </br> </br><b>Data Collection</b> - the intelligent collection of network structure and traffic information from a variety of sources for use in the analysis. </br></br> <b>Visualisation</b> - the design and development of effective interactive visualisations of the network's structure and traffic.</br></br>
		For more information on the project specifics, see the <a href="ProjectProposal.pdf">Project Proposal</a> or browse the <a href="documentationpage.html">project documentation</a>.

<div><h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
	The network managers and engineers of Africa's research and educational institutions and those of the UbuntuNet Alliance seek to improve the performance of information exchange between these institutions to facilitate the network-intensive collaborative work done between them. Currently, there is a lack of research into effective network data collection and visualisation tools in the context of the UbuntuNet and African NRENs. This research would be useful in that it helps develop tools to facilitate network design, planning and operation and, in the distinct context of NRENs, aids policy makers in the determination of whether the establishment of an NREN between two communicating institutions within the same country is viable.
