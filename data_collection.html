                    <h1>Topology Discovery for African NRENs</h1>
                    <p>A National and Research and Education Network (NREN) is a mesh of interconnected networks that support the needs of education and research communities in a country. The UbuntuNet Alliance is an association of NRENs in Southern and Eastern Africa.
NRENs aim to reduce latencies between educational institutions in order to facilitate better research and communication. However, it has been found that about 75% of the Internet traffic between NRENs in Africa is routed outside the continent resulting in high latencies.</p>

<p>There is a need for a platform which collects and displays accurate data about NREN topologies in Africa. This platform will help future researchers to see which networks exchange data circuitously and evaluate how and where networks can be improved. It will also add to the discussion and argument for why more local peering could be beneficial to African networks.</p>

<p>The paper below aims to find out: can Traceroute data be collected reliably and efficiently for the purpose of discovering the topology of African NRENs? By “reliably”, it is meant to increase the accuracy of these measurements and ensure that the topology discovered is complete. A topology is complete if all the paths defining that topology have been found. By “efficiently”, it is meant to reduce the number of measurements to perform for obtaining a complete topology. </p>

                    <h1>Overview</h1><p>Using the RIPE Atlas platform, Traceroute measurements were conducted from 12 vantage points to 50 destination IP addresses within the UbuntuNet Alliance. The protocols ICMP, TCP and UDP were used. Since some protocols are blocked by firewalls on routers, all three protocols were used to discover the most complete topology.</p>

<p>The experiment was initially run three times in an attempt to find as many paths as possible from each source to each destination. Routing and load balancing can provide a diverse set of paths depending on the congestion of the network and how packets were subsequently routed at a particular time, which is why the experiment was run more than once. Three full measurements were conducted from each probe to each target IP address using each of the three protocols. The paths of these measurements were analysed to find overlaps. Once this had been completed, three more sets of Traceroute measurements were run for each protocol where first hops and last hops were changed where necessary.</p>
<p>A summary of the results are found below. For more information, please consult the full report at the bottom of this page.</p>
